Uploaded version of computer vision code from our high school FRC project

Essentially, code is comprised of a python script that performs a computer vision "algorithm" of sorts to determine the location of a yellow cube in a 2D plane - i.e. how far is it, and left or right.
There are many scripts in this repository that were part of the development process, but ultimately the two most imporant ones were the 2018_vision_version_two and the HSV_camera_slider_V3.0.

These were last worked on in 2018, so the directory is far more chaotic than those of my modern projects.
